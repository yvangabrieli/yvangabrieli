# 👋 Hey! I'm Yvan Gabrieli

🌍 Based in Spain · 💻 Building backend projects with Java & Spring Boot · ☁️ Exploring SQL/NoSQL & APIs  
I solve problems, manage teams, communicate in 4 languages… and (most of the time) I fix bugs 😅

## 🚀 What I'm up to
🏗️ Creating backend APIs and microservices with Spring Boot  
🧪 Practicing testing, clean architecture, and modular design
